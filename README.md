# Milestone 1 - Music School - by Kevin Bourke

This project is a small website for a Music School. The main purpose would be to get people interest in taking the music classes on offer from the music school. It promotes the positive benefits of learning music to help sell the classes. The website will display the various intruments that they teach as well as upcoming classes.
 
## UX

### User Stories
 
This section provides insight into the UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how this project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

- As a user who is thinking about learning a musical instrument, I want to find out information that might convince me to take a class. The option of taking a free introductory class would be quite appealing. (image of free class)
- As a user who has already begun learning an instrument, perhaps I want to find some more formal training, to help me progress, or to add other related skills like reading music. (image of classes)
- As a user who might have children who are interested in music, I want to find out if these classes look appropriate, and where they take place. (image of Teachers, references to children, map)

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.
### Strategy
My goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible to access information on the site while striving for a minimalist and user-friendly design.

### Scope
For employers, I wanted to provide them with a brief overview of myself and my capabilities. This way, they would be able to get a glimpse of who I am, my background, work I've done, and my skills, with the option to contact me if they choose.

### Structure
In the 'Work/Travail' section, I wanted them to be able to quickly access work that I've done, providing a short summary of the project and main technologies with a link to each GitHub Repository and live demo. A link to my LinkedIn profile, my GitHub, and a downloadable PDF version of my CV were also provided for their ease of access.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users contact the school, by having them fill out the contact form.
- 

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named `index.html`.

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
